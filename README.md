## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.7+:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
*   **Groq API Key:**
    *   Sign up at [console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys).
    *   Generate a new API key. Keep this key confidential.

### 2. Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (or Download):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name # Replace with your actual repository name
    ```
    *(If you just uploaded files manually to GitHub, then download the repository as a ZIP from GitHub and extract it.)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

4.  **Configure API Key:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project (the same folder as `app.py`).
    *   Add your Groq API key to this file:
        ```
        GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
        ```
    *   **Important:** The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to GitHub for security reasons.
